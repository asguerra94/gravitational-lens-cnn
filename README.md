This repository contains the work produced by our team for Astrodataton 2024, a competition that focuses on developing neural network models for processing astronomical data related to weak gravitational lenses.

# Project Overview

In the context of weak gravitational lensing, small distortions in the images of distant galaxies are caused by the gravitational influence of massive objects. These distortions, although subtle, provide valuable information about the mass distribution in the universe and the nature of dark matter.

The goal of this project was to build a neural network model capable of accurately analyzing and processing these distortions from observational data.

# Approach

To guide our methodology, we referred to the research presented in the Astrophysical Journal titled “Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Detect Weak Gravitational Lensing.” This paper provided valuable insights into leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this specific task. The competition challenged us to apply advanced machine learning techniques to improve upon traditional methods used in astronomy.

# Structure

	•	Data Preprocessing: Handling and cleaning astronomical data to feed into our model.
	•	Model Design: Building and fine-tuning a CNN architecture for detecting weak lensing effects.
	•	Evaluation: Analyzing the model’s performance based on accuracy and robustness in various scenarios.
	•	Results: Our final submission for the competition, which includes metrics and visualizations of the model’s predictions.

# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the Astrodataton 2024 organizers for the opportunity to work on this fascinating challenge. Special thanks to our team members for their collaboration and effort throughout the project. Additionally, we acknowledge the guidance provided by the article in the Astrophysical Journal, which played a pivotal role in shaping our approach.

This README should serve as a good introduction to your project for anyone visiting the GitHub repository. Let me know if you’d like to make any adjustments!
